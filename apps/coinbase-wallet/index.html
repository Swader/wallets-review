                                        <p><span>C</span>oinbase Wallet, previously known as Toshi Wallet, is a
                                            multi-chain wallet relatively recently acquired by <a
                                                href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/542b0423734ab06764000001">Coinbase</a>.
                                            It comes with its own dapp browser and supports multiple blockchain
                                            protocols.</p>

                                        <p>The wallet and dapp browser are standard fare. There's the basic web3
                                            injection for Ethereum dapps in the dapp browser with the ability to
                                            bookmark your favorites. The selection of pre-added ones is rich, but hardly
                                            unique. It's the same set we're seeing everywhere: <a

                                        <p>From a user-experience side, the wallet is quite simple with big buttons and
                                            simple colors, and should be intuitive for even the most uninitiated
                                            blockchain user. The ability to authorize every transaction with a
                                            fingerprint dramatically reduces complexity. However, the UI does also
                                            suffer from some glitches and the app will lock up and crash from time to
                                            time. It happened to me 3 times in 10 minutes, enough to become frustrating
                                            to use.</p>

                                        <p>There's no ENS support, so you need to input full recipient addresses.
                                            Curiously, the app greets you with a message saying you'll be able to send
                                            money to other people simply using their Coinbase Wallet username, and
                                            you're even prompted to register one in the beginning, but this never
                                            appears again in any context, and I couldn't figure out how to use it.</p>

                                        <p>The application <a href="https://github.com/coinbasewallet">seems to be
                                                partially open source</a>, at least some of its past components. I say
                                            "past" because it used to contain reputation management and chat - both of
                                            which used centralized servers - but those features now seem to be missing
                                            from the app.</p>

                                                <p>For an app which started as an open source project, it's sad to see it close

                                        <p>For merchant uses, the app wouldn't be much use outside of Bitcoin. While
                                            there is <a
                                                href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki">BIP-21</a>
                                            support, there is no full <a
                                                href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/681">EIP-681</a> support and
                                            there's no way to even see past transactions of your account. So if you
                                            receive or send a tx, you'll have to look it up by checking your address
                                            elsewhere, as there's not even a way to get a TX ID from Coinbase Wallet, a
                                            big UX negative. The QR code reader also stops working from time to time,
                                            simply not even recognizing QR codes other wallets have no problems with.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>For an app which started as an open source project, it's sad to see it close
                                            its doors to developers with not only the closing of its source code, but
                                            also the fact that custom nodes and RPC endpoints cannot be added into the
                                            app at all. It depends on Infura and as such is quite censorable and
                                            breakable.</p>

                                        <p>There is no KYC, but there is the option to combine your
                                            <a
                                                href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/542b0423734ab06764000001">Coinbase</a>
                                            account with the Wallet in order to be able to pull money from it directly without manually sending.
                                        
                                        <div class="imgContainer">

                                        </p><p>This means that any KYC you provided to Coinbase
                                            is now available to the developers of Coinbase Wallet, and that Coinbase
                                            also have information on your other tokens, if you used them in this app
                                            prior to linking accounts. Tread carefully.</p>

                                        <p>Coinbase wallet will auto-detect any ERC20 and ERC721 tokens you receive, so
                                            you can play with even the most exotic ones. Case in point:

                                            <div class="imgContainer">
<img src="/apps/coinbase-wallet/img01.png" alt="The Bruno Token is here">
                                            </div>

                                        </p>

                                        <p>The app is currently available on Android and iOS, and though it bears the
                                            Coinbase name, it is not available as part of Coinbase's web UI. With
                                            another layer or two of polish, Coinbase Wallet could be the next Trust
                                            Wallet in terms of usability and user experience, but it sadly drags its
                                            feet in a way that's reminiscent of a hostile takeover for the sake of
                                            competition elimination, not acquisition. It's not clear what Coinbase
                                            intends to do with this app, but one thing is obvious - this is not a
                                            finished product. What's not obvious is - why.</p>
